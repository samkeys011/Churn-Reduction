# Churn-Reduction
Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving.  The objective of this Case is to predict customer behaviour. We are provided with a public dataset that has customer usage pattern and if the customer has moved or not. We are expected to develop an algorithm to predict the churn score based on usage pattern.
